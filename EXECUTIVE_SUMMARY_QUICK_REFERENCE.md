## Decision Guide

### SCALE ✓
**When**: Break-even prob ≥ 70%, Risk stable/improving
**Meaning**: Aggressively increase investment
**Best For**: Emerging/Growth trends with strong fundamentals

### MONITOR ⚠️
**When**: Break-even prob 40-70%, Risk stable
**Meaning**: Maintain investment and watch closely
**Best For**: Growth/Peak trends with moderate conditions

### TEST_SMALL 🧪
**When**: Break-even prob < 40%, Risk worsening
**Meaning**: Pilot with limited budget first
**Best For**: Decline trends or unvalidated assumptions

### AVOID ❌
**When**: Break-even prob < 20%, Loss prob > 60%
**Meaning**: Do not pursue this scenario
**Best For**: Dormant trends or high-risk combinations

## Risk Levels

| Level | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Low | 0-25 | Minimal volatility, stable |
| Moderate | 25-50 | Normal volatility, manageable |
| High | 50-75 | Significant volatility, elevated |
| Critical | 75-100 | Extreme volatility, severe |

## Success Levels

| Level | Probability | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Very High | 80%+ | Excellent outlook |
| High | 60-80% | Strong outlook |
| Moderate | 40-60% | Moderate outlook |
| Low | 20-40% | Weak outlook |
| Very Low | <20% | Very weak outlook |

## Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Characteristics | Investment Timing |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Emerging | Early, growth potential, limited data | Early adopter advantage |
| Growth | Expanding, strong momentum, rising engagement | Scale aggressively |
| Peak | Maximum adoption, high saturation, volatility | Maintain position |
| Decline | Losing momentum, decreasing engagement | Wind down |
| Dormant | Inactive, minimal engagement, high risk | Avoid |

## Quick Interpretation

### High Break-Even Probability (80%+)
✓ Strong financial case
✓ Likely to recover investment
✓ Consider scaling

### Moderate Break-Even Probability (40-70%)
⚠️ Moderate financial case
⚠️ Requires careful execution
⚠️ Consider monitoring

### Low Break-Even Probability (<40%)
❌ Weak financial case
❌ High risk of loss
❌ Consider avoiding

### Worsening Risk Trend
⚠️ Risk is increasing
⚠️ Conditions deteriorating
⚠️ May need to reduce exposure

### Improving Risk Trend
✓ Risk is decreasing
✓ Conditions stabilizing
✓ May be safe to scale

## Common Scenarios

### Emerging Trend + High Break-Even Prob
**Recommendation**: SCALE
**Rationale**: Early-stage with strong potential
**Action**: Secure creators, allocate budget, monitor weekly

### Peak Trend + Moderate Break-Even Prob
**Recommendation**: MONITOR
**Rationale**: Profitable but saturated
**Action**: Focus on differentiation, maintain investment

### Declining Trend + Low Break-Even Prob
**Recommendation**: AVOID
**Rationale**: Losing momentum, high risk
**Action**: Redirect budget, wind down campaigns

### Growth Trend + Worsening Risk
**Recommendation**: TEST_SMALL
**Rationale**: Good potential but increasing risk
**Action**: Pilot program, validate assumptions

## Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Break-Even Probability**: Is success likely?
2. **Expected ROI**: What's the financial return?
3. **Risk Trend**: Is risk improving or worsening?
4. **Data Coverage**: How confident are we?
5. **Most Sensitive Factor**: What assumption matters most?

## Before Making a Decision

✓ Review the recommended posture
✓ Check the rationale
✓ Verify risk tolerance alignment
✓ Validate critical assumptions
✓ Review action items
✓ Consult with stakeholders
✓ Consider external factors

## Remember

- This is a **simulation**, not a guarantee
- Assumptions may change
- External factors matter
- Monitor actual results vs. projections
- Update simulations as new data arrives
- Use as a decision support tool, not the only input

## Questions to Ask

1. **Does the recommendation align with our strategy?**
2. **Are we comfortable with the projected risk?**
3. **Do we have the resources for the recommended posture?**
4. **Are the critical assumptions realistic?**
